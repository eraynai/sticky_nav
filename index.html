      <h2>About Cats</h2>
      <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae
        and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family. The cat is either a
        house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; latter ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by
        humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various
        cat registries.
        The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species, has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp
        teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well
        developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and
        grunting as well as cat-specific body language. It is a solitary hunter, but a social species. It can hear
        sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals. It
        is a predator that is most active at dawn and dusk. It secretes and perceives pheromones.
        Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes ranging from two to five
        kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to
        control breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as abandonment of pets, resulted in large numbers
        of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird species, and evoking population control.
        It was long thought that cat domestication was initiated in Egypt, because cats in ancient Egypt were venerated
        since around 3100 BC. However, the earliest indication for the taming of an African wildcat (F. lybica) was
        found in Cyprus, where a cat skeleton was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave dating to around 7500 BC.
        African wildcats were probably first domesticated in the Near East.
        As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States by number of pets owned, after
        freshwater fish, with 95 million cats owned. In the United Kingdom, around 7.3 million cats lived in more than
        4.8 million households as of 2019.</p>

      <h2>Domestic</h2>
      <p>The earliest known indication for a tamed African wildcat was excavated close by a human grave in
        Shillourokambos, southern Cyprus, dating to about 9,200 to 9,500 years before present. As there is no evidence
        of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the inhabitants of this Neolithic village most likely brought the cat and
        other wild mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern mainland. Scientists therefore assume that African
        wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the Fertile Crescent by rodents, in particular the house
        mouse (Mus musculus), and were tamed by Neolithic farmers. This commensal relationship between early farmers and
        tamed cats lasted thousands of years. As agricultural practices spread, so did tame and domesticated cats.
        Wildcats of Egypt contributed to the maternal gene pool of the domestic cat at a later time. The earliest known
        evidence for the occurrence of the domestic cat in Greece dates to around 1200 BC. Greek, Phoenician,
        Carthaginian and Etruscan traders introduced domestic cats to southern Europe. During the Roman Empire they were
        introduced to Corsica and Sardinia before the beginning of the 1st millennium. By the 5th century BC, they were
        familiar animals around settlements in Magna Graecia and Etruria. By the end of the Roman Empire in the 5th
        century, the Egyptian domestic cat lineage had arrived in a Baltic Sea port in northern Germany.
        During domestication, cats have undergone only minor changes in anatomy and behavior, and they are still capable
        of surviving in the wild. Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have preadapted them for
        domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play
        and relatively high intelligence. Captive Leopardus cats may also display affectionate behavior toward humans,
        but were not domesticated. House cats often mate with feral cats, producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat in
        Scotland. Hybridisation between domestic and other Felinae species is also possible.
        Development of cat breeds started in the mid 19th century. An analysis of the domestic cat genome revealed that
        the ancestral wildcat genome was significantly altered in the process of domestication as specific mutations
        were selected to develop cat breeds. Most breeds are founded on random-bred domestic cats. Genetic diversity of
        these breeds varies between regions, and is lowest in purebred populations, which show more than 20 deleterious
        genetic disorders.</p>

      <h2>Claws</h2>
      <p>Cats have protractable and retractable claws. In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with
        the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the
        ground and allows the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the fore feet are typically sharper than those on
        the hind feet. Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in
        hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Cats shed the outside layer
        of their claw sheaths when scratching rough surfaces.</p>

      <h2>Balance</h2>
      <p>Most breeds of cat have a noted fondness for sitting in high places, or perching. A higher place may serve as a
        concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch.
        Another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to survey its
        territory. A cat falling from heights of up to 3 meters can right itself and land on its paws. During a fall
        from a high place, a cat reflexively twists its body and rights itself to land on its feet using its acute sense
        of balance and flexibility. This reflex is known as the cat righting reflex. An individual cat always rights
        itself in the same way during a fall, provided it has sufficient time to do so. The height required for this to
        occur is around 90 cm (3.0 ft). Cats without a tail also have this reflex.</p>
